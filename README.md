Introduction
------------

First of all, you have to download and import UUnit package to your project.
I suggest all test cases to be located on a separate folder inside your project's "Assets root" (ie: Assets/Scripts-tests/).
It's also a good practice to organize your test cases on folders that mirror the structure of the code being tested.
(ie.: Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Laser.cs
      Assets/Scripts-tests/Weapons/LaserTest.cs)
Here's a quick recipe for a new test case (feel free to copy and paste it to your file):

```C#
using UnityEngine;

public class YourClassTest : UUnitTestCase
{
  protected override void SetUp() {
  }

  [UUnitTest]
  public void ShouldDoSomething() {
  }

  protected override void TearDown() {
  }
  
}
```
